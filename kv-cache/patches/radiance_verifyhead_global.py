# radiance house port 2026-10-06: radiance_verifyhead.py from magiccodingman/vllm-radiance PR #9
# (open; head 900636411f9a79f1f1cb9489eaee81714600fcbd, Terrydaktal/vllm-radiance), whose base is
# byte-identical to the vendored ggz14 980f891 copy. One local change: the _rerank_exact call is
# adapted to ggz14's signature (scale tensor + FP8 flag). No licence published upstream.
# Installed by kv-cache/patch_verifyhead_global.py only over that exact base.
"""Experimental INT2 target head with BF16-weight reranking and full-head fallback.

The default target method selects 256 candidates globally from the complete
INT2 score row. RADIANCE_VERIFY_HEAD_GLOBAL_TOPK=128 selects a smaller global
shortlist; setting 0 restores block selection with the sampled capacity gate
top_k <= min(RERANK // 4, KCAND). That gate is necessary, not a recall proof.

Global candidate selection removes the per-tile
cap. Every selected token is rescored using the original BF16 weights; the
other logits become -inf. The drafter keeps its existing block-8 shortlist.
The global path is limited to TP1, BF16, and at most 32 target rows per call.

Both paths are approximate. Greedy winner recall is not guaranteed, and
reranking against BF16 weights does not imply bitwise equality to the full
BF16 GEMM. A real 61K-token TP1 replay retained the full top-20 in 649/650
rows with global-256 and also observed retained-logit differences. This is
not a completeness certificate or a distribution-preserving target head.

Grammar, logprobs, unsupported sampled top-k/min-p and wide batches use the
full head. Global selection additionally declines biases, penalties, bad-word
masks, thinking-budget interventions and unsupported layouts. No certificate
failure can be detected by this implementation: approximate recall misses can
still pass the global path. Use RADIANCE_VERIFY_HEAD=0 for the full target head
on every request.

RADIANCE_VERIFY_HEAD=1 requires RADIANCE_FAST_DRAFT=1 to build the shared INT2
packing. Setting GLOBAL_TOPK alone does not enable target-head optimization.
See docs/VERIFY_HEAD_GLOBAL_TOPK.md for measurements, scope and configuration.
